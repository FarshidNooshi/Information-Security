# Information Security Course Repository

This repository contains three Python projects related to Information Security. Each project has its own directory with the necessary code and documentation to understand the project's purpose and how it works.

## 1. IP Scan, Port Scan, and Ping Application

This project is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application that allows users to perform network scans on a target IP address. The app includes functionality to scan for open ports, perform a ping test, and get information about the target IP's operating system. The app is built to be fast and efficient, allowing users to quickly get information about their network environment.

## 2. Encryptor and Decryption Package

This project is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using different encryption techniques. The app provides a flexible interface to easily choose the desired encryption method and perform the encryption or decryption process. The app also supports various encryption algorithms, including AES and RSA. The aim of this project is to show the importance of encryption in communication and the different techniques that can be used for this purpose.

## 3. Malware (System Information Collector)

This project is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application that collects and sends system information to a server. The program runs on the client's system and gathers information such as hardware information, operating system model, and other critical details about the system. The collected information is then transmitted to a server, which is waiting to receive it.
The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use solution for gathering and sending system information for further analysis. The CLI interface makes it convenient for users to run the program and transmit the information, without having to navigate through a graphical user interface. The program is written in Python and is designed to be easy to use and maintain.
